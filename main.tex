\section{Introduction}
This project aims to find an algorithm to determine
the side length of the largest square that can be
inscribed inside a convex $n$-gon. It is a continuation from
a previous project completed in 2021, The Bigger The Better. \cite{tbtb1}

\subsection{Rationale}
Do note that the definition of inscribed is such that all vertices of the square lie on the sides of the polygon.

\subsection{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the side length of the largest square that can be inscribed in a triangle?
	\item What is the side length of the largest square that can be inscribed in a regular $n$-gon, given $n \neq 4$?
	\item What is the side length of the largest square that can be inscribed in a convex $n$-gon?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Project Scope}
This project will mainly focus on polygons which are convex. This allows many restrictions to be made.

\section{Research Question 1}

\subsection{Introduction}
The first research question aims to find out the side length of the largest square that can be inscribed in a triangle, given the side lengths of the triangle.

\subsection{Key insights}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It can be seen that no more than 2 vertices of a square can lie on a single side, as a square has at most 2 vertices lying on a single line.
	\item We notice how a triangle has 3 sides, and a square has 4 vertices. In order for all the vertices to lie on the triangle, by pigeonhole principle, at least one side has at least 2 vertices lying on it.
	\item Combining the first 2 insights, we can see that 2 sides of the triangle will have 1 vertices each lying on it, while the other side will have 2 vertices lying on it.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{align*}
s\ &=\ \frac{c}{1+\cot \angle A+\cot \angle B} \\
&=\frac{c\sin \angle A}{\sin \angle A+\cos \angle A+\cot \angle B\sin \angle A} \\
&=\frac{c\sin \angle A\sin \angle B}{\sin \angle A\sin \angle B+\cos \angle A\sin \angle B+\sin \angle A\cos \angle B} \\
&=\frac{c\sin \angle A\sin \angle B}{\sin \angle A\sin \angle B+\sin\left(\angle A+\angle B\right)} \\
&=\frac{c\sin \angle A\sin \angle B}{\sin \angle A\sin \angle B+\sin\left(180-\angle C\right)} \\
&=\frac{c\sin \angle A\sin \angle B}{\sin \angle A\sin \angle B+\sin \angle C} \\
&=\frac{2Rc\sin \angle A\sin \angle B}{2R\sin \angle A\sin \angle B+2R\sin \angle C} \\
&=\frac{ac\sin \angle B}{a\sin \angle B+c} \\
&=\frac{2Rac\sin \angle B}{2Ra\sin \angle B+2Rc} \\
&=\frac{abc}{2Rc+ab} \\
s_{max}=\max\left(\frac{abc}{2Rc+ab},\frac{abc}{2Rb+aa},\frac{abc}{2Ra+bc}\right)
