\section{Introduction}
This project aims to find an algorithm to determine
the side length of the largest square that can be
inscribed inside a convex $n$-gon. It is a continuation from
a previous project completed in 2021, The Bigger The Better. \cite{tbtb1}

\section{Research Question 1}

RQ1 aims to find out the side length of the largest square that can be inscribed in a triangle,
given the side lengths of the triangle, $a$, $b$ and $c$.

\subsection{Key Insights}
Some key insights which greatly aided in solving this problem were found.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It can be seen that no more than two vertices of a square can lie on a single side,
	      as a square has at most two co-linear vertices.
	\item We notice how a triangle has three sides, and a square has four vertices.
	      In order for all the vertices to lie on the triangle, using the Pigeonhole Principle,
	      there will be at least one side with two vertices lying on it.
	\item Combining the above insights, there will be one vertex of the square
	      each lying on two sides of the triangle, with the other two vertices of the square
	      lying on the latter side of the triangle.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Solution}
A figure has been constructed for the purposes of illustrating the following proof.

Let $s$ be the side length of the largest square that can be inscribed in a triangle,
with side lengths $a$, $b$ and $c$, and circumradius $R$.

Side $c$ can be formed with the sum of $s$, $s \cot A$ and $s \cot \angle{B}$.
Hence, we can express $s$ with the side length $c$, as well as angles $A$ and $B$.

\begin{align*}
	c & = s+s\cot \angle{A}+s\cot \angle{B}          \\
	s & = \frac{c}{1+\cot \angle{A}+\cot \angle{B}}                                                                            
\end{align*}

Both sides of the fraction can be multiplied by $\sin A \sin B$. Following which, the
Sine Addition Formula can be applied.

\begin{align*}
	s & = \frac{c \sin\angle{A}}{\sin\angle{A}+\cos\angle{A}+\cot\angle{B}\sin\angle{A}}                                       \\
	  & = \frac{c\sin\angle{A}\sin\angle{B}}{\sin\angle{A}\sin\angle{B}+\cos\angle{A}\sin\angle{B}+\sin\angle{A}\cos\angle{B}} \\
	  & = \frac{c\sin\angle{A}\sin\angle{B}}{\sin\angle{A}\sin\angle{B}+\sin\left(\angle{A}+\angle{B}\right)}                  \\
	  & = \frac{c\sin\angle{A}\sin\angle{B}}{\sin\angle{A}\sin\angle{B}+\sin\left(180-\angle C\right)}                         \\
	  & = \frac{c\sin\angle{A}\sin\angle{B}}{\sin\angle{A}\sin\angle{B}+\sin \angle C}                                         
\end{align*}

Both sides of the fraction can be multiplied by $2Rc$ and the Law of Sines can be used to simplify.

\begin{align*}
	 s & = \frac{2Rc\sin\angle{A}\sin\angle{B}}{2R\sin\angle{A}\sin \angle{B}+2R\sin \angle C}                                  \\
	  & = \frac{ac\sin\angle{B}}{a\sin\angle{B}+c}                                                                             \\
	  & = \frac{2Rac\sin\angle{B}}{2Ra\sin\angle{B}+2Rc}                                                                       \\
	  & = \frac{abc}{2Rc+ab}
\end{align*}
% We used formulae and theorems such as the sine addition formula and the law of sines to manipulate the expressions. \\

Since each of the sides of the triangle, $a$, $b$ and $c$ can be the longest side,
the maximum of the three placements can be taken as the solution, hence
\begin{equation}
	s_{\text{max}} = \max\left(\dfrac{abc}{2Rc+ab},\dfrac{abc}{2Rb+ac},\dfrac{abc}{2Ra+bc}\right)
\end{equation}

For obtuse triangles, only one placement exists, i.e. when the square lies on the longest side.
\begin{equation}
	s = \dfrac{abc}{2Rc+ab}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the longest side.

\section{Research Question 2}

RQ2 aims to find out the side length of the largest square that can be inscribed in a convex $n$-gon,
given $n$ and the side length of the $n$-gon, $k$.

This problem can be further split into four cases.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item when \(n \equiv 0\) (mod $4$),
	\item when \(n \equiv 2\) (mod $4$),
	\item when \(n \equiv 1\) (mod $4$),
	\item when \(n \equiv 3\) (mod $4$). 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Case 1}
This case deals with the scenario where the number of sides in the $n$-gon is divisible by $4$.

Firstly, for the side length of the square to be maximised, more than one vertex of the square must coincide with the perimeter of the $n$-gon.
This can be easily seen, because the square can be pushed outwards in the other direction if less than two vertices of the square touch the perimeter of the $n$-gon.

Also, due to such a polygon being symmetrical both horizontally and vertically, the assumption that the centre of the polygon coincides with the centre of the square can be made. From the earlier observation, it can be assumed that one vertex of the square, $A$, lies on the perimeter of the polygon.
